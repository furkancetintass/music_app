[Korean:]

떠나볼까 let me fly to my
시선을 낮추고 어디든 막 zoom
지금 나와 let me fly to my
Get me outta my blues
And now I'm feelin' brand new

Everyday
답답해 미치겠어
Feel like it's still day one
누가 저 시계를 좀 돌려줘
올해 다 뺏겼어
아직 난 침대 속
거북해 속이
It's killin' me slowly nah
Anyway
떠나고파 any way
뭐 방법이 없어
이 방이 내 전부
그럼 뭐 여길
내 세상으로
바꿔보지 뭐
Yeah

떠나볼까 let me fly to my room
시선을 낮추고 어디든 막 zoom
지금 나와 let me fly to my room
Get me outta my blues
And now I'm feelin' brand new

Everywhere
여기가 이랬나 싶어
갑자기 낯선 이 풍경
괜히 추억에 잠겨
오래된 책상도
달라진 햇빛도
특별해 보이네
I'm little less lonely nah
Better way
I just found a better way
Sometimes we get to know
Broken is beautiful
가벼워 몸이
날아가 멀리
This thing so surreal
Yeah

떠나볼까 let me fly to my room
시선을 낮추고 어디든 막 zoom
지금 나와 let me fly to my room
Get me outta my blues
And now I'm feelin' brand new

이 방은 너무 작지
그래 나의 꿈을 담기에 (yah yah yah)
침대 그 위로 착지
여기가 제일 안전해
어쩜 기쁨도 슬픔도 어떤 감정도
여긴 그저 받아주네 (yah yeh yah)
때론 이 방이 감정의 쓰레기통이 돼도
날 안아주네
또 나를 반겨주네
사람들 같은 내방 toy들
마치 시내를 나온 듯이 북적여
TV 소리는
생각은 생각이 바꾸면 돼
여긴 나만 즐길 수 있는 travel
배달음식은
낙관적으로 채워봐, I'm full

떠나볼까 let me fly to my
시선을 낮추고 어디든 막 zoom
지금 나와 let me fly to my
Get me outta my blues
And now I'm feelin' brand new

떠나볼까 let me fly to my room (ah)
시선을 낮추고 어디든 막 zoom
지금 나와 let me fly to my room
Get me outta my blues
And now I'm feelin' brand new
떠나볼까 let me fly to my room
시선을 낮추고 어디든 막 zoom (you)
지금 나와 let me fly to my room (fly)
Get me outta my blues (ah yeah)
And now I'm feelin' brand new (new)

[English translation:]

Let's go, let me fly to my
Keep your gaze down and zoom anywhere
Come on now, let me fly to my
Get me outta my blues
And now I'm feelin' brand new

Everyday
It's so frustrating, it's driving me crazy
Feel like it's still day one
Somebody give me back the clock
I lost everything this year
I'm still in bed
A bloated stomach
It's killin' me slowly, nah
Anyway
I want to leave any way
There's no way
This room is all I have
Then, what can I do here?
Into my world
Let's change it, yeah

Let's go, let me fly to my
Keep your gaze down and zoom anywhere
Come on now, let me fly to my
Get me outta my blues
And now I'm feelin' brand new

Everywhere
I wonder if this place was like this
Suddenly this strange scenery
I'm absorbed by memories
Even the old desks, the changed sunlight
Looks special
I'm little less lonely, nah

Better way
I just found a better way
Sometimes we get to know
Broken is beautiful
I'm light
Fly away
This thing is so surreal
Yeah

Let's go, let me fly to my room
Keep your gaze down and zoom anywhere
Come on now, let me fly to my room
Get me outta my blues
And now I'm feelin' brand new

This room is too small
Yes, to contain my dream (Yah, yah, yah)
Landing over the bed
This is the safest place
Somehow there's no joy, no sadness, no emotion
It's just me here
Sometimes this room becomes an emotional trash can
It hugs me

They greet me again
The toys in my room, like people
It's as crowded as if we're out of town
The sound of TV
You can change your mind
This is a travel that only I can enjoy
Delivery food
Fill it up with optimism, I'm full

Let's go, let me fly to my room
Keep your gaze down and just zoom anywhere
Come on now, let me fly to my
Get me outta my blues
And now I'm feelin' brand new

Let's go, let me fly to my room
Keep your gaze down and just zoom anywhere
Come on now, let me fly to my room
Get me outta my blues
And now I'm feelin' brand new
Let's go, let me fly to my room
Keep your gaze down and just zoom anywhere
Come on now, let me fly to my room
Get me outta my blues
And now I'm feelin' brand new
