너 땜에 나 이렇게 망가져
그만할래 이제 너 안 가져
못하겠어 뭣 같아서
제발 핑계 같은 건 삼가줘

니가 나한테 이럼 안 돼
니가 한 모든 말은 안대
진실을 가리고 날 찢어
날 찍어 나 미쳐 다 싫어
전부 가져가 난 니가 그냥 미워

But you're my everything (You're my)
Everything (You're my)
Everything (You're my)
제발 좀 꺼져 huh

미안해 (I hate u)
사랑해 (I hate u)
용서해 (shit)

I need you girl
왜 혼자 사랑하고 혼자서만 이별해
I need you girl
왜 다칠 걸 알면서 자꾸 니가 필요해

I need you girl 넌 아름다워
I need you girl 너무 차가워
I need you girl (I need you girl)
I need you girl (I need you girl)

It goes round & round 나 왜 자꾸 돌아오지
I go down & down 이쯤 되면 내가 바보지
나 무슨 짓을 해봐도 어쩔 수가 없다고
분명 내 심장, 내 마음, 내 가슴인데
왜 말을 안 듣냐고
또 혼잣말하네 (또 혼잣말하네)
또 혼잣말하네 (또 혼잣말하네)
넌 아무 말 안 해 아 제발 내가 잘할게
하늘은 또 파랗게 (하늘은 또 파랗게)

하늘이 파래서 햇살이 빛나서
내 눈물이 더 잘 보이나 봐
왜 나는 너인지 왜 하필 너인지
왜 너를 떠날 수가 없는지

I need you girl
왜 혼자 사랑하고 혼자서만 이별해
I need you girl
왜 다칠 걸 알면서 자꾸 니가 필요해

I need you girl 넌 아름다워
I need you girl 너무 차가워
I need you girl (I need you girl)
I need you girl (I need you girl)

Girl 차라리 차라리 헤어지자고 해줘
Girl 사랑이 사랑이 아니었다고 해줘
내겐 그럴 용기가 없어
내게 마지막 선물을 줘
더는 돌아갈 수 없도록

I need you girl
왜 혼자 사랑하고 혼자서만 이별해
I need you girl
왜 다칠 걸 알면서 자꾸 니가 필요해

I need you girl 넌 아름다워
I need you girl 너무 차가워
I need you girl (I need you girl)
I need you girl (I need you girl)

Falling

Because of you, I'm becoming ruined
I wanna stop, I don't want you anymore
I can't do it, this sucks
Please don't give me any excuses

You can't do this to me
All of the things you said are like a mask
It hides the truth and rips me apart
It pierces me, I'm going crazy, I hate this
Take it all away, I hate you

But you're my everything (You're my)
Everything (You're my)
Everything (You're my)
Please go away huh

I'm sorry (I hate u)
I love you (I hate u)
Forgive me (shit)

I need you girl
Why am I in love alone, why am I hurting alone
I need you girl
Why do I keep needing you when I know I'll get hurt?

I need you girl, you're beautiful
I need you girl, you're so cold
I need you girl (I need you girl)
I need you girl (I need you girl)

It goes round & round, why do I keep coming back
I go down & down, at this point, I'm just a fool
Whatever I do, I can't help it
It's definitely my heart, my feelings
But why don't they listen to me
I'm just talking to myself again (talking to myself again)
I'm just talking to myself again (talking to myself again)
You're not saying anything, please, I'll treat you well
But the sky is blue (the sky is blue)

The sky is blue and the sun is shining
So my tears are even more noticeable
Why is it you? Why did it have to be you?
Why can't I leave you?

I need you girl
Why am I in love alone, why am I hurting alone
I need you girl
Why do I keep needing you when I know I'll get hurt?

I need you girl, you're beautiful
I need you girl, you're so cold
I need you girl (I need you girl)
I need you girl (I need you girl)

Girl, just tell me you wanna break up
Girl, just tell me it wasn't love
I have no courage to say that
Give me my last gift
So I can't ever go back to you

I need you girl
Why am I in love alone, why am I hurting alone
I need you girl
Why do I keep needing you when I know I'll get hurt?

I need you girl, you're beautiful
I need you girl, you're so cold
I need you girl (I need you girl)
I need you girl (I need you girl)
