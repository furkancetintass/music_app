아님 어떤 다른 뭐라 해도 (해도)
I don't care
I'm proud of it
난 자유롭네
No more irony
나는 항상 나였기에

손가락질 해, 나는 전혀 신경 쓰지 않네
나를 욕하는 너의 그 이유가 뭐든 간에
I know what I am
I know what I want
I never gon' change
I never gon' trade

때론 슈퍼히어로가 돼
돌려대 너의 Anpanman
24시간이 적지
헷갈림, 내겐 사치
I do my thang
I love myself

I love myself, I love my fans
Love my dance and my what
내 속안엔 몇 십 몇 백명의 내가 있어
오늘 또 다른 날 맞이해
어차피 전부 다 나이기에
고민보다는 걍 달리네

[English translation:]

You can call me artist (artist)
You can call me idol (idol)
Or any other something you come up with
I don't care
I'm proud of it
I'm free
No more irony
For I was always myself

Point your fingers, I couldn't care less
No matter what your reason to blame me is
I know what I am
I know what I want
I never gon' change
I never gon' trade
(Trade off)

What you keep babbling about
I do what I do, so mind your own business
You can't stop me lovin' myself

Ursoo it's awesome
You can't stop me lovin' myself

FACE OFF, just like John Woo, ay
Top star with that spotlight, ay
Sometimes become a superhero
Spin it your Anpanman
24 hours isn't much
Confusedness, for me it's a luxury
I do my thang
I love myself

I love myself, I love my fans
Love my dance and my what
There are tens and hundreds of myself in me
I welcome another me today
After all, all of them is me
I just go at it rather than to sit on it
Runnin' man
Runnin' man
Runnin' man

What you keep babbling about
I do what I do, so mind your own business
You can't stop me lovin' myself

Ursoo it's awesome
You can't stop me lovin' myself

Sometimes I find the longest way to go around
It's okay, I'm in love with my-myself
It's okay, I'm happy in this moment

You can't stop me lovin' myself
Hooray it's so awesome
You can't stop me lovin' myself
