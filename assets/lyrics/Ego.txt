[J-hope:]
매일 돌아가 본다고
그때의 나로
포기를 선택한 삶으로
날 놓아본다고
But 세상에는 있지
변하지 않는 몆 진실
시간은 앞으로 흐른다는 것
만약은 없단 것
까마득해질 만하면 생각나 그 시절
악마의 손길과 운명의 recall
궁금해 아직도 왜 다시 불렀는지도
매일 ask me, guess it, 채찍, repeat, oh
변할 건 없다며 결국 또
걱정을 억지로 잠궈, close
How much love? How much joy?
위안을 주며 stay calm, alone

그래 I don't care, 전부 내
운명의 선택, so we're here
내 앞을 봐, the way is shinin'
Keep goin' now
(Ready, set, and begin)

그 길로, 길로, 길로
Wherever my way
오직 ego, ego, ego
Just trust myself

(2 Cool, 2 Cool 4 Skool)
문득 스쳐가는 j-hope이 아닌 정호석의 삶
희망이란 없고 후회만 가득했겠지 'til I die
(2 Cool, 2 Cool 4 Skool)
춤은 뜬 구름을 잡을 뿐 나의 꿈을 탓할 뿐
살아 숨쉬는 거에 의문을
Oh my God (God, God, God)
Uh, time goes by
7년의 걱정이 드디어 입 밖으로
모두 해소되는 핍박
가장 믿던 그들의 답은 내 심장으로
하나뿐인 hope, 하나뿐인 soul
하나뿐인 smile, 하나뿐인 너
세상 그 진실에 확실해진 답
변하지 않는 그 어떤 나, right

이제 I don't care, 전부 내
운명의 선택, so we're here
내 앞을 봐, the way is shinin'
Keep goin' now
(Ready, set, and begin)

그 길로, 길로, 길로
Wherever my way
오직 ego, ego, ego
Just trust myself

믿는 대로 가는 대로
운명이 됐고 중심이 됐어
힘든 대로 또 슬픈 대로
위로가 됐고 날 알게 됐어
Map of the Soul, map of the all (Map of the Soul)
That's my ego, that's my ego

That's my ego, that's my ego (Map of the Soul)

I go back every day
To me of yesterday
To the life of giving up
I let myself go away
But in this world, you know
There are truths unchanged
Time rushes ever forward
There's no ifs, buts, or maybes
Almost forgotten memories return
Touch of the devil, fateful recall
I still wonder, why did they beckon again
Every day ask me, guess it, whip it, repeat oh
Nothing that will change, so
I lock it up again, close
'How much love? How much joy?'
Soothe myself and stay calm, alone

Yeah I don't care, it's all
Choices by my fate, so we're here
Look ahead, the way is shinin'
Keep goin' now
(Ready, set, and begin)

That way, way, way
Wherever my way
Only ego ego ego
Just trust myself

(2 Cool, 2 Cool 4 Skool)
Life not of j-hope but Jeong Ho-Seok flashes by
It must have been full of regret with no hope 'til I die
(2 Cool, 2 Cool 4 Skool)
My dancing was chasing ghosts
Blaming my dream, asking why I live and breathe
Oh my God (God, God, God)
Uh time goes by
Seven years of anguish come out finally
Oppressions all resolved
Into my heart come answers from my most trusted
'Only one hope, only one soul'
'Only one smile, only one you'
Definite answer to the truth of the world
Only one and unchanging me, right

Now I don't care, it's all
Choices by my fate, so we're here
Look ahead, the way is shinin'
Keep goin' now
(Ready, set, and begin)

That way, way, way
Wherever my way
Only ego ego ego
Just trust myself

Way I trust, way I go
Became my fate, became my core
Hard it was, and sad it was
Still reassured and made me know myself

Map of the Soul, map of the all (Map of the Soul)
That's my ego, that's my ego
