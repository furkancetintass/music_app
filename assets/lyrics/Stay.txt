[Korean:]

꿈이었을까
널 본 것 같아
눈뜨면 다시
아무도 없는 방
가만히 난 주문을 걸어
그 어느 때보다 크게 뛰는 heart
이 순간 우리 언제라도 어디 있대도
Together, wherever yeah
(Wherever yeah)

반복도 복인 것 같아
나도 모르겠어 나의 속을
널 볼 순 없을까
가만히 모아보네 두 손을
변하지 않는 내일
미친놈처럼 I keep sayin'
Wherever you are
I know you always stay

저 구름이 지나간 자리에
Stay
마른 입술로 너에게 말해
Stay, stay, stay, stay (Always)
Yeah I know you always stay
Yeah I know you always stay
Yeah I know you always stay

찬란한 오늘의
그 모두를 위해
Oh every night and day
Yeah, I know you always stay

바로 지금 난 널 생각해
니가 어디에 있던지
그게 뭐가 중요해
We connect to 7G
It ain't the end of the world
The present, it shine like a pearl
이건 몇 파동에 불과
하지만 내가 널 바꿔놓을 거야

가만히 난 주문을 걸어
그 어느 때보다 밝게 보이는 star
이 순간 우린 언제라도 어디 있대도
Wherever you are
I know you always stay

저 바람이 지나간 바다에
Stay
굳은 입술로 네게 말을 해
Stay, stay, stay, stay (Always)
Yeah I know you always stay
Yeah I know you always stay
Yeah I know you always stay

찬란한 오늘의
그 모두를 위해
Oh every night and day
Yeah, I know you always stay

찬바람이 불어와
손 내밀어 네 숨결을 느껴
눈 감은 어느새
우린 함께인 걸

[English translation:]

Was it a dream?
I think I saw you
When I open my eyes again
The room's empty

Hold still, it's an order
Our heart beats are louder than ever
No matter where we are right now
Together, wherever yeah
(Wherever yeah)

I think it's a blessing to repeat
I don't know either, my heart
Can't I see you?
I put my hands together
Tomorrow that does not change
Like a madman, I keep sayin'
Wherever you are
I know you always stay

In the place where that cloud passed by
Stay
I tell you with dry lips
Stay, stay, stay, stay (Always)
Yeah I know you always stay
Yeah I know you always stay
Yeah I know you always stay

For all of those brilliant todays
Oh, every night and day
Yeah I know you always stay

Right now I think of you
Wherever you are
It doesn't matter
We connect to 7G
It ain't the end of the world
The present, it shine like a pearl
These are just a few crisis
But I'm gonna change you

Hold still, it's an order
The stars are brighter than ever
No matter where we are right now
Wherever you are
I know you always stay

In the sea where the wind passed by
Stay
I'm talking to you with firm lips
Stay, stay, stay, stay (Always)
Yeah I know you always stay
Yeah I know you always stay
Yeah I know you always stay

For all of those brilliant todays
Oh, every night and day
Yeah I know you always stay

The cold wind blows
I take your hand, I feel your breath
I close my eyes
We are together
