[J-Hope:]
Yeah who says my spoon is dirty
I don't care I grab the mic, I got several golden spoons
I lash out, y'all undercooked, several of you steaks
I'll chew you out repeated, on the evening of the stars'
World Business headline
#1 casted, sold out
There's not a lot on this class, we fully enjoy the value
Bad smell on a good scent is against the rules
Mic mic bungee

[Suga:]
Mic mic bungee
Bright light, step forward
It probably seemed like we were gonna fail, I'm fine, sorry
Sorry Billboard
Sorry worldwide
I'm sorry your son is too successful
Fulfill the fillial duty that you didn't do
We never have a concert, grape
I do it I do it you are a tasteless ratatouille
If you're jealous, then sue me
Sue it

[V, J-Hope, Jin, Jimin:]
Did you see my bag

My bag is full of trophies
How you think bout that

Haters are struggling
It's already golden, golden, my success
I'm so firin' firin' torch relay
You hurriedly, hurriedly run away
How you dare
How you dare
How you dare

[Jungkook, J-Hope, Rap Monster:]
Ah there's too many trophies in my hands
It's too heavy, my hands aren't enough

So busy having one body isn't enough
MIC Drop

Careful of your feet, feet

[Rap Monster:]
This is totally what they say
Right always prevails ah
Once upon a time
Aesop's fables fly
Look at your reality, serves, serves your right
I can die happy this instant
Which country are we going to now
How many hours is it on the plane
Yeah I'm on the mountain
Yeah I'm on the bay
We collapse on the stage
MIC Drop baam

There's no need to meet again, this is final goodbye
There's nothing to say, don't even apologize
There's no need to meet again, this is final goodbye
There's nothing to say, don't even apologize
You'll see, you'll end up like that
We're piercing like coke
Your corneas are shocked
