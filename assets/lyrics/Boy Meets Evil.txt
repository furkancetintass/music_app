Too bad but it's too sweet
It's too sweet it's too sweet
Too bad but it's too sweet
It's too sweet it's too sweet

Too bad but it's too sweet
It's too sweet it's too sweet
Too bad but it's too sweet
It's too sweet it's too sweet

It's too evil
It's too evil
It's too evil
Yeah it's evil

[Korean:]

어두워져 가 내 미래의 빛
치기 어린 사랑에 잃은 꿈의 길
내 야망의 독기 매일 칼을 갈았지
But 참을 수 없는 내 욕심에
칼은 무뎌져
알고 있어 다
이 사랑은 악마의 또 다른 이름
손을 잡지 마
외쳤지만 저버렸지 내 양심을
날이 갈수록 느끼는 날카로운 현실들
현실에 찢겨 붉게 묻은 피들
생각 못했지
그 욕심이 지옥을 부르는 나팔이 될 지는
Breathe
숨이 차오르고
뒤틀린 현실에 눈 감는 매일 밤
울리는 비극의 오르골
But 이 죄를 벗기엔
그걸 잊는 게 당최 포기가 안돼
그 입술이 너무 달콤했기에
연애에 취해서 버려진 미래
깨어나고 볼 땐 이미 사방엔 지뢰
건드릴 수 없는 매서운 주위의 시선들
기적을 외쳐 이 현실에
(Rewind)
미치도록 좋았지
달콤함에 중독된 병신
그래 병신
놓치긴 싫었어 악마의 손길을

Too bad but it's too sweet
It's too sweet it's too sweet
Too bad but it's too sweet
It's too sweet it's too sweet

Too bad but it's too sweet
It's too sweet it's too sweet
Too bad but it's too sweet
It's too sweet it's too sweet

It's too evil
It's too evil
It's too evil
Yeah it's evil

[English translation:]

The light of my future is dimming
Because of my childish love, I lost my way on a path of dream
The venom of my ambition, I sharpened my knife every day
But because of my uncontrollable greed,
My knife became dull
I know it all
This love is another name for the devil
Don't hold her hand
I shouted but turned away from my conscience
I feel the sharp reality more every day
There's red blood from being torn apart by reality
I never thought that
The greed would become the trumpet heralding hell
Breathe
My breath is getting shorter
I close my eyes every night from twisted reality
The music box of tragedy echoes
But in order to be free from this crime
It's impossible to forget and give up
Because those lips were too sweet
I threw my future away because I was drunk on dating
When I woke up, I was surrounded by land mines
Surrounded by people's stares that can't be touched
I shout for a miracle in this reality
(Rewind)
It was crazy good
I was an idiot addicted to sweetness
Yeah an idiot
I didn't want to let go of the devil's hand

Too bad but it's too sweet
It's too sweet it's too sweet
Too bad but it's too sweet
It's too sweet it's too sweet

Too bad but it's too sweet
It's too sweet it's too sweet
Too bad but it's too sweet
It's too sweet it's too sweet

It's too evil
It's too evil
It's too evil
Yeah it's evil
