[Romanized:]

24 nuguboda deo ppalli eoreuni doen geonman gata
My life has been a movie all the time
Hae tteuneun goseuro dallyeosseo every single night
Nuguui naeire gabwatdeon geotdo gata
On sesangi neomu keotdeon geu sonyeon
Keep on runnin' errday mic jabadeureo
Friends ridin' subway, I'll be in the airplane mode
Jeon segyereul rock on I made my own lotto
But neomu ppareun geonji nochyeobeorin heunjeogi
Don't know what to do with

And yes you know yes you know
Oh I can't call ya I can't touch ya

Can I someday finna find my time
Finna find my time
Someday finna find my time

Oh I think I was in yesterday
Cuz everybody walk too fast

Can I someday finna find my time
Finna find my time

Ttaeron naui sum makil ttaemyeon
Mojal nulleosseugo gyesok dallyeo
Yeah I don't gotta know where I go
Even if it's opposite of sun
One time for the present
Two time for the past
Happy that we met each other
Now til' the very end

Oh I will call ya I will hol' ya
Oh I will
And yes you know yes you know
Oh I will call ya I will touch ya
Oh I will
And you know
Can I someday finna find my time
Can I someday finna find my time
Finna find my time

[Korean:]

24 누구보다 더 빨리 어른이 된 것만 같아
My life has been a movie all the time
해 뜨는 곳으로 달렸어 every single night
누구의 내일에 가봤던 것도 같아
온 세상이 너무 컸던 그 소년
Keep on runnin' errday mic 잡아들어
Friends ridin' subway, I'll be in the airplane mode
전 세계를 rock on I made my own lotto
But 너무 빠른 건지 놓쳐버린 흔적이
Don't know what to do with
Am I livin' this right?
왜 나만 다른 시공간 속인 걸까

Oh I can't call ya I can't hol' ya
Oh I can't
And yes you know yes you know
Oh I can't call ya I can't touch ya
Oh I can't
Let me know
Can I someday finna find my time
Finna find my time
Someday finna find my time

Oh I think I was in yesterday
Cuz everybody walk too fast
나도 모르게 커버린 어린 나
(길을 잃어버린 어린아이처럼)
This got me oh just trippin'
서성대는 이 느낌
Don't know what to do with
Am I livin' this right?
왜 나만 다른 시공간 속인 걸까

Oh I can't call ya I can't hol' ya
Oh I can't
And yes you know yes you know
Oh I can't call ya I can't touch ya
Oh I can't
Let me know
Can I someday finna find my time
Finna find my time
Someday finna find my time

때론 나의 숨 막힐 때면
모잘 눌러쓰고 계속 달려
Yeah I don't gotta know where I go
Even if it's opposite of sun
One time for the present
Two time for the past
Happy that we met each other
Now til' the very end

Oh I will call ya I will hol' ya
Oh I will
And yes you know yes you know
Oh I will call ya I will touch ya
Oh I will
And you know
Can I someday finna find my time
Can I someday finna find my time
Finna find my time
Find my time

[English translation:]

24, I feel like I became an adult faster than everyone else
My life has been a movie, all the time
I ran to where the sun rose, every single night
It's like I've also visited someone's tomorrow
The boy who thought the world was too big
Keep on runnin' all day, pick up my mic
Friends ridin' subway, I'll be in the airplane mode
Rock on the whole world, I made my own lotto
But is it too fast? Traces of what I've missed
Don't know what to do with
Am I livin' this right?
Why am I alone in a different time and space?

Oh I can't call ya I can't hol' ya
Oh I can't
And yes you know yes you know
Oh I can't call ya I can't touch ya
Oh I can't
Let me know
Can I someday finna find my time
Finna find my time
Someday finna find my time

Oh I think I was in yesterday
Cuz everybody walk too fast
Without me realizing, the young me grew up
(Like a child who lost his way)
This got me oh just trippin'
This feeling that lingers around
Don't know what to do with
Am I livin' this right?
Why am I alone in a different time and space?

Oh I can't call ya I can't hol' ya
Oh I can't
And yes you know yes you know
Oh I can't call ya I can't touch ya
Oh I can't
Let me know
Can I someday finna find my time
Finna find my time
Someday finna find my time

Sometimes when I'm out of breath
I press down my hat and keep running
Yeah I don't gotta know where I go
Even if it's opposite of sun
One time for the present
Two time for the past
Happy that we met each other
Now til' the very end

Oh I will call ya I will hol' ya
Oh I will
And yes you know yes you know
Oh I will call ya I will touch ya
Oh I will
And you know
Can I someday finna find my time
Can I someday finna find my time
Finna find my time
Find my time
